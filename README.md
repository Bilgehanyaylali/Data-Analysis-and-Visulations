 In section 4)Advanced_Functional(EDA).py we talk about Advanced Functional Exploratory Data Analysis

What Is It?
A crucial step in data analysis is exploratory data analysis (EDA), which entails a dataset's initial inspection and investigation. 
Its main goal is to provide an overview of the data's key features, frequently using summary statistics and visualisation, 
in order to shed light on the data's organisation, trends, and possible problems.

Within data science, exploratory data analysis, or EDA, is a basic and frequently used method. It entails carefully 
looking into and evaluating a dataset in order to highlight its key features using a variety of statistical and visual techniques.
EDA is used for a variety of tasks, such as finding patterns in data, spotting anomalies, testing theories, and verifying presumptions. 
It is very similar to data analytics and data analysis, which are related procedures that help draw important conclusions from data so that 
decisions can be made with knowledge. To put it succinctly, EDA is a technique that enables scientists to decide how best to manipulate
a given dataset in order to accomplish their objectives and extract valuable information.
