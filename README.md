ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
Investigative Data Analysis: Influence on Data Science Investigative data analysis
In the 1970s, the innovative American mathematician John Tukey developed exploratory data analysis, or EDA. 
As we move forward in time, EDA techniques continue to be a mainstay of the data discovery process and are a commonly used approach. 
Beyond formal modelling or hypothesis testing, EDA opens up a world of possibilities for learning more about the variables in a 
dataset and the complex web of relationships that exist between them. Moreover, it is essential in determining whether 
the statistical methods designated for data analysis are appropriate.
In a world where data is everywhere, EDA is a powerful tool for revealing the subtleties and stories hidden inside datasets.
It gives data scientists the ability to spot anomalies, uncover hidden patterns, and even spark the creation of new theories.
By encouraging this close relationship with the data and pointing analysts in the direction of the most appropriate analytical techniques, 
EDA serves as a compass. It is particularly good at assisting with missing value identification, locating the third quartile,
calculating the interquartile range, and determining correlations between other variables. Understanding the intricate relationships 
between data points and the complexity of most datasets is made much easier with the help of EDA. Its continued importance 
in the field of data science emphasises how crucial a role it will play in determining how data-driven decision-making is shaped going forward.
What Is It?
A crucial step in data analysis is exploratory data analysis (EDA), which entails a dataset's initial inspection and investigation. 
Its main goal is to provide an overview of the data's key features, frequently using summary statistics and visualisation, 
in order to shed light on the data's organisation, trends, and possible problems.
Within data science, exploratory data analysis, or EDA, is a basic and frequently used method. It entails carefully 
looking into and evaluating a dataset in order to highlight its key features using a variety of statistical and visual techniques.
EDA is used for a variety of tasks, such as finding patterns in data, spotting anomalies, testing theories, and verifying presumptions. 
It is very similar to data analytics and data analysis, which are related procedures that help draw important conclusions from data so that 
decisions can be made with knowledge. To put it succinctly, EDA is a technique that enables scientists to decide how best to manipulate
a given dataset in order to accomplish their objectives and extract valuable information.
